I build musical interfaces using custom software and hardware. I craft intense performances with these systems, sometimes in holes, on rooftops, or in the wastelands surrounding large cities. Currently, I am a master’s student at Stanford University’s CCRMA. Read more about me, view my CV, or get in touch to ask why I believe in bugs.
