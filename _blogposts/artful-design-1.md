#### Reading Response: Visible Aims v.s Subtle Preferences

#### “Design…always entails the search for some yet unknown way of how the pieces fit together…with a specific set of visible aims and subtle preferences…” - pg. 39

Over the past year I’ve been thinking a lot about the interplay between my visible aims and subtle preferences as both a live performer and designer of custom musical interfaces. When I first started working in this space I entered with many assumptions. I believed that the interface I was designing had to be first and foremost usable by other people **(visible aim)**. I assumed that I had to divorce these artifacts from the values—deep, aesthetic, even spiritual—that have guided my work for years **(subtle preferences)**. Undoubtedly influenced by the pragmatic literature on human-computer interaction that I was engrossed in at the time, I thought that mixing the functional aspects of my new interface with my aesthetic values was questionable and maybe even wrong. It almost felt as if doing so would violate some fundamental principle of design.

Luckily, my advisor Adam asked the right questions and slowly nudged me towards recognizing the fact that my aesthetic values had always been there, just beneath the surface, and were guiding most, if not all, of my design decisions. As I continued working on my thesis project I couldn’t help but notice how much heavy lifting these values or subtle preferences were actually doing. Through long-term reflection, I realized that these values were a wellspring of intention that guided most of the minute decisions I made about how my interface should work, what kinds of objects I should have on stage, and how these objects should be placed in space. In practice, my aesthetic values were not secondary to or separate from my functional values. They always unfolded in tandem, intertwined through time and space, and, when in harmony, resulted in technologically-mediated performances that profoundly touched my audience and brought magic into both of our lives.

I’m at a point now where I feel comfortable surfing the dissonance caused by the interplay between form, or aesthetics, and function. I am excited about artful design because it speaks to my ongoing experience of reconciling these seemingly disparate parts of my work and existence. Artful design feels like a gentle affirmation of my journey and a call to dig deeper, to reflect more, and to relax into the sublime embrace of radical synthesis.

#### Design Etude: Taking Notice

*I decided to write about a singular experience I had with a set of designed objects a couple of weeks ago. I wrote about the things themselves and a related social interaction. Pray forgive my lack of a Thing #3, for I couldn't stop writing and ended up with 1200+ words...*

#### Thing #1: Three Vacuum Trucks Sing in Unison

Although spirituality, deep listening, and meditation are central to my life, I tend to think of myself as being metaphysically grounded. I don’t see ghosts, I don’t believe in the existence of a transcendent, planet-sized goddess, and I’ve never encountered Jesus in my morning toast. But two weeks ago I experienced something out of this world. This might seem strange to you, but I heard the sound of three vacuum trucks singing in unison. It was the most beautiful sound I have ever heard in my life. 

The sound stopped me in my tracks. At first, I thought someone was playing ambient music out of their apartment window. The sound pulled me closer, almost against my will, and so I walked forwards to find out what it was. I turned a corner and then I saw it, or more specifically, them: three trucks owned by Atlas Carpet Cleaning Inc. They were singing in unison, with all kinds of tubes and cables snaking out of their bodies, almost like intestines spilling out into the light.

I realized that the sound was coming out of engines powering the equipment being used to clean the nearby apartment building. Each engine was oscillating at the same frequency. However, due to the wear-and-tear inherent to mechanical systems, each engine was slightly detuned. What emerged from this interplay of oscillating, detuned frequencies was a haunting, droning note, interspersed with all kinds of creaking, clacking, and buzzing noises that coalesced into the sound of mechanical crickets melancholically chirping on a summer night. I got closer to the trucks and something inside of me broke. I couldn’t think, I couldn’t process what was happening, I could only listen and surrender to what I was experiencing. The sound filled me, and filled me, and filled me. I quickly accepted that the boundary between my self, my body, and the sound was fraying. It hurt, but in a good way. It was *sublime*. 

Were these vacuum truck engines designed to make this sound? Obviously not. Their function was to help clean carpets. Nevertheless, when placed next to each other they produced one of the most beautiful and engaging sounds I’ve ever heard. When considering why I found their singing so beautiful, I think about the shift of perspective that I experienced when listening to them. I’m used to hearing music produced intentionally by humans and technology. I am even familiar with birdsong and bugsound. But witnessing three machines making such stirring music—without any human involvement whatsoever—jolted me out of my everyday experience and thrust me into a wild world where everything is sentient and anything is possible. I firmly believe that any design artifact that elicits such a perspective shift is powerful indeed, even if this shift is completely unintended by the original maker. 

I am curious: could the lens of artful design expand to include such kinds of non-human intention and liveliness?

#### Thing #2: A Social Interaction Near the Singing Vacuum Trucks, or, Education as the Design of Experience

While I was listening to the singing trucks, a worker from Atlas Carpet Cleaning Inc. stepped out of the nearby apartment. He looked at me, probably wondering why I was standing in awe near his vehicles. I figured that any expression of wonder at the sound of his engines would just be met with confusion and consternation. But having just heard the most stirring sound of my life, I couldn’t help but yelp “that sound coming out of your trucks! It’s beautiful!”. A conspiratorial look of recognition dawned on his face “Oh yeah, cool! Are you into sound? I had a high school drama teacher that would make music using different parts of the piano… he would bang on it and play the strings and everything… it was awesome.”

Our conversation didn’t last much longer but I found this social interaction incredibly inspiring. An educator had so fundamentally altered this man’s relationship to sound that he immediately understood why I was standing there listening to his engines. There was no hesitation on his part. He knew what I was listening to and why it was important to me. 

Normally, education is seen as a means to an end. Take musical education, for example, and notice how it is most often utilized to become more proficient at playing an instrument, or more well-versed in a specific repertoire of music. But what I heard in this man’s voice was different. His high school drama teacher had changed his relationship to sound in such a way that he too could sense the sublime in the sound of three vacuum truck engines; in the act of listening as an end in itself. It's almost as if the experiental knowledge imparted by that high school teacher had designed this man's experience of the world to be more open to sonic beauty, even in the most mundane of places. I think that’s pretty damn cool and I feel more motivated than ever to teach as a result of this interaction.
