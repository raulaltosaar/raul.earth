<p style="text-align: center">🐞 Coming soon, currently under development. 🐞</p>

<!-- I am an artist and researcher. Currently, I am developing customized musical interfaces using virtual reality technology, sensors, and code. These systems prioritize the relationship between my body and the material world. This results in musical performances that are physically demanding and site‑specific.

My work has appeared at conferences including the ACM international conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interactions, the Music in New Technologies conference, the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts conference, and the European Conference on Computer Vision, and has also been exhibited internationally in museums and festivals including the LAST Festival at Stanford University, the Ontario Science Centre, and The Wrong New Digital Art Biennale.

You can find my CV here. -->
