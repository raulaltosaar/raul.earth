          <p>I collect knowledge about the history and future of computation. I store this knowledge in a research channel named <a href="https://www.are.na/raul-altosaar/embodied-computation" target="_blank" title="Embodied Computation">Embodied Computation</a> on are.na. </p>

          <p>In 2017 I performed a series of virtual reality rituals with various collaborators. Documentation from these rituals was exhibited in The Wrong New Digital Art Biennale in Hong Kong and Seoul, Korea.

          <p>I have been intermittently crafting noise music and mixtapes under the alias of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/destroyer_12" target="_blank">DESTROYER_12</a> for the past four years. Critics have described these productions as "ecological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber" target="_blank">gabber</a>" and "music that guides the listener through the portals of liminality". This work has been released by <a href="https://bratrecords.bandcamp.com/album/brat-compilation-volume-2-vesna" target="_blank">BRAT Records</a> and has been featured in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/discmagazine/disc-024-floating-rooftop-healing-mix-destroyer_12" target="_blank">Disc Magazine</a>. </p>

    <p>In 2017 I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R61n22gTkdo" target="_blank">a 360º artwork</a> about emergent lifeforms and non-linear love. The soundtrack was composed using crowdsourced audio recordings collected from fifty classmates and family members.
