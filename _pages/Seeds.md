  <p>I recently made a mixtape to explore the sound of life throbbing on a damaged planet; the sound of entire worlds rising and falling, screaming out of grief and elation.</p>

  <p>My family and I created this digital drawing that was later <a href="http://undergroundflower.com/snapdragon.html" target="_blank">exhibited inside a corner store</a> in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. In the image, you can see my sister and I holding the remnants of an ancient tradition in which molten lead is cast into cold water and used to foretell our family's fate for the new year.</p>

<p>In 2017 I performed a series of LARPed rituals with my sister and various other collaborators. Documentation from these experiences was exhibited in <a href="https://thewrong.org/about" target="_blank">The Wrong New Digital Art Biennale</a> in Hong Kong and Seoul, and was also featured on <a href="https://www.aqnb.com/2017/11/15/why-do-we-appropriate-life-hacking-into-taught-identity-with-fantasy-direct-group-show-at-seouls-yongma-charm-space/" target="_blank">AQNB</a> and <a href="http://tzvetnik.online/portfolio_page/fantasy-direct-yongma-land-charm-space/" target="_blank">Tzvetznik.</a></p>

<p>I sometimes craft noise music and mixtapes under the alias of <a href="https://soundcloud.com/destroyer_12" target="_blank">DESTROYER_12</a>. Humans have described this work as "ecological <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabber" target="_blank">gabber</a>" and "music that guides the listener through the portals of liminality". My music has been released by <a href="https://bratrecords.bandcamp.com/album/brat-compilation-volume-2-vesna" target="_blank">BRAT Records</a> and has been featured in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/discmagazine/disc-024-floating-rooftop-healing-mix-destroyer_12" target="_blank">Disc Magazine</a>.</p>

<p>In 2017 I made a 360º video about blue pandas from outer space, emergent lifeforms, and non-linear love. The soundtrack was composed using crowdsourced audio recordings collected from fifty classmates and family members. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/exilevevo/i-may-not-be-ready-2-shit-out-a-liquid-diamond-and-share-it-but-i-can-try-kenji-remix" target="_blank">Remixed by Kenji Yamamoto.</a></p>
