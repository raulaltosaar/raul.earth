## A Very Real Looper ##

A custom musical interface developed for the HTC Vive VR system. The Looper lets you place virtual sounds onto physical objects and perform musicâ€”without a headset. The interface is now open-source and you can read the technical breakdown on [Github](https://github.com/raulaltosaar/a-very-real-looper){:target="_blank"}.

In November 2018 I was invited to present and perform with this project at the [Music In New Technologies](http://mintconference.ca/) conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This work was also featured in [a group exhibition](https://belindakwan.com/files/multiplecontingencies_catalogue.pdf) at the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts conference in Toronto, Ontario.
