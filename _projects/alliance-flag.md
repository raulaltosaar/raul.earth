### Alliance, Flag

#### An experimental animation and proof-of-concept for an augmented reality application. ####

This video was an experiment in mixed reality animation. It was also a proof-of-concept for a location-based AR application in which non-human creatures could be witnessed roaming around the urban wastelands. 3D models were sculpted in ZBrush, textured using Substance Painter and then rigged and animated in Maya. The animation was rendered using Arnold to match real-world lighting and then seamlessly composited into 4k footage using After Effects.
