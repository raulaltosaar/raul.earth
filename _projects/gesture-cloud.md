### Depth Cloud

In the summer of 2018 I was a research assistant to professor [Judith Doyle](http://www.readingpictures.com/about.html), Principal Investigator of the [Social Media and Collaboration Lab](https://www2.ocadu.ca/research/smac/about) at OCAD University. I worked on this project in collaboration with [William Wu](https://willy-vvu.github.io/) at MIT. 

We were tasked with converting archival volumetric videos into animated point clouds and staging them in a virtual reality environment. Noise algorithms were then added to these animations in order to reveal gesture and motion trajectories.

My role in the project focused on technically implementing our solutions in Unreal Engine 4.

A final proof-of-concept of the animated point clouds can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/287691875).
