### Distributed Computation ### 

#### A large, non-visual virtual reality instrument that is controlled using gesture and bodily movement. ####

A blog post describing the process behind the creation of this instrument can be read [here](/a-very-real-looper-post).
An extended abstract written about this project is currently up for review at this year's conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interactions. You can read a preprint of that document [here](/assets/pdf/physically_colliding_with_music_TEI.pdf).

Contrary to how virtual reality (VR) is normally utilized, a performer playing A Very Real Looper *(AVRL)* is not disconnected from their surrounding environment through visual immersion, nor is their body restrained by a head-mounted display.

Rather, *AVRL* uses VR sensors in conjunction with a game engine to map musical sounds and sequences onto physical objects and spaces. These sounds are then by triggered by a performer simply wielding two controllers.

*AVRL* thus combines the affordances of the physical world with the modularity of a game engine, consequently activating the expressive potential of the body inside of a large, highly reconfigurable, and musically augmented environment.

In November 2018 I was invited to present and perform with this project at the [Music In New Technologies](http://mintconference.ca/) conference in Halifax, Nova Scotia. This work was also featured in [a group exhibition](https://www.facebook.com/events/684502281920358/) at the Society for Literature, Science, and the Arts conference in Toronto, Ontario.
